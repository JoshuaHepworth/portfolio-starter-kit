# Portfolio Starter Kit

## Objectives

- Build a cool portfolio
- Get hosting and a custom domain name
- Host our cool portfolio on our custom Domain Name

## Repo

First thing's first - create a new repo for your project. Initialize it with a readme and an index.html file that gives a simple 'hello world':

```html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<title>My Portfolio</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	</body>
	</html>
```

This will be important as we set up hosting - we'll want some sort of visual indication that our setup is working.

There's a sample index.html file in this repo, but make sure your portfolio is not in a fork of this repo - make it yourself, so that future employers can see that this project is ALL YOU!

## Hosting

Let's start with the more technical side of this project - getting hosting and a domain name. 

Hosting, in a nutshell, is renting a folder on a server for your project to live in. Much like renting an apartment, quality and cost can varry wildly. Here's a few suggestions:

2.) **Pick an established company.** I would suggest any of these:

- [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) - Standard fair hosting service. around $25/mo. Handles domain, email, and other common services for you. Almost unlimited storage.
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) - Cheap and scalable - only pay for what you use (could be as low as $1-3). No frills. 
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) Cloud app hosting - Probably overkill for what you need, but good if you want to scale to hosting full apps. Price tiers based on usage, from free - $500/mo.

Every hosting service has its own unique strenths and shortcomings, as listed above. 


There's millions of companies that will host your website, 

### Top Level Domains

Your website can end with a lot more than .com - here's a complete rundown:

- .com - standard, totally fine

- .co - cool and new

- .___ (new top level domains): http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt - great if relevant

- .net, .biz - NEVER.
